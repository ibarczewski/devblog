## Project Manager

I'm in love with Project Manager. I use my work laptop for side projects as well as client work, so I often have to bounce back and forth between the two. Project Manager allows me to define where projects are located, and then jump to that project simply by going to the sidebar and selecting it. Plus, it has excellent git integration, so I can jump from repo to repo. Cannot live without this extension to keep all of my Github graveyard side projects organized.

## Bookmarks

If Project Manager is the organizer of all of my projects, Bookmarks is the organizer of spots in the code that I am jumping between. You select a line, bookmark it, and then jump back and forth between bookmarks by either using the sidebar or using shortcuts. Excellent when you want to keep a list of things you know you need to change.

## Quokka

Quokka RULES. No longer do you need to go to the Chrome Dev Tools console or CodePen to write out a quick and dirty idea. Open up the command prompt, select "Quokka: New JavaScript File," and you have a fully functional Dev Tool console clone. Quokka executes immediately with each keystroke, while simultaneously showing in-line evaluations of the code. It will even execute pre-existing files! I love, love, love Quokka.
