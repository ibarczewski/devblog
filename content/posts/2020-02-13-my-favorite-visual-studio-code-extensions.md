One of the things people bring up when working on my Visual Studio Code instance is the sheer amount of extensions I have installed. I'm overly obsessed with extensions. They make my development life a lot easier and have enhanced my productivity in countless ways. One might call me an extension enthusiast. Sure, great. That's fine.

I started a Slack channel at work to talk about VS Code extensions. As I started typing out what I had, I realized that I would probably be better off writing out an entire blog post. 

Anyways, here's the list of my extensions that I use often. My development life is far better because of these extensions, and I am endlessly grateful to the developers who created these.
 
## Prettier

One of the best libraries out there, Prettier takes an opinionated approach into reformatting your code to conform to a style. No more arguments and debates about styles, no need to make a style guide. Prettier enforces a style.

The Visual Studio Code extension does the enforcement of these styles on the fly when you save. Great so that you can see the changes live instead of/before you've ran Prettier in the terminal or as part of a commit hook.

## Project Manager

I'm in love with Project Manager. I use my work laptop for side projects as well as client work, so I often have to bounce back and forth between the two. Project Manager allows me to define where projects are located, and then jump to that project simply by going to the sidebar and selecting it. Plus, it has excellent git integration, so I can jump from repo to repo. Cannot live without this extension to keep all of my Github graveyard side projects organized.

## Bookmarks

If Project Manager is the organizer of all of my projects, Bookmarks is the organizer of spots in the code that I am jumping between. You select a line, bookmark it, and then jump back and forth between bookmarks by either using the sidebar or using shortcuts. Excellent when you want to keep a list of things you know you need to change.

## GitLens

GitLens has a ton of really incredible features that are not able to be captured in a single photo, such as seeing the author name on top of code blocks, being able to hover over areas to see what the last change made was along with the commit message, being able to explore git repositories with full scale file and line histories. 

However, I really love the simple in-line author name and time of commit shown on the side of the code you're looking at. I have used this a ton to be able to immediately track down who I need to talk to when needing additional context. Brilliant tool and much more robust than Visual Studio Code's git integration.

## ES7 Snippets

## ESLint

## Import Cost

Simple - see the sizes of the packages you're importing, along with color customizations for when an imported package reaches a size threshold (which is also configurable!) Really useful when you're working on a project that requires tight size requirements.

*Note: I have heard that people have had issues with this extension not working/hanging in a calculation loop, so your mileage may vary. I personally have never had an issue with it.*

## Indent Rainbow

## Rainbow Brackets

## Javascript Console Utils

## Settings Sync

While I can't use a screenshot for this, the name of the extension should be pretty clear. By connection your GitHub account, you can sync your Visual Studio Code settings to the account and then auto upload/download all of the changes as they occur. You can share the gist that is generated to other users as well so that they can sync your changes to their machine. 

## Toggle Quotes

Super simple, super useful. Use âŒ˜ + ' (Ctrl + ' if on Windows) to cycle the quotes surround a string between ', ", and `. Handy little shortcut.

## Regex Previewer

Using a keyboard shortcut, Regex Previewer will open up a side window and highlight the matches against the current expression that you are highlighted on. I don't use this a ton, but it is extremely helpful when I need to write quick and dirty Regex.

## Quokka

Quokka RULES. No longer do you need to go to the Chrome Dev Tools console or CodePen to write out a quick and dirty idea. Open up the command prompt, select "Quokka: New JavaScript File," and you have a fully functional Dev Tool console clone. Quokka executes immediately with each keystroke, while simultaneously showing in-line evaluations of the code. It will even execute pre-existing files! I love, love, love Quokka.
