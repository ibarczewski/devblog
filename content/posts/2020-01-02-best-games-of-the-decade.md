### What Remains Of Edith Finch

The walking sim genre had a brief moment in the sun early in the decade. In the span of two years, most of the hallmark games of the genre were released to critical acclaim - *The Stanley Parable, Gone Home, Dear Esther, The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter -* before vanishing from the spotlight just as quickly as it arrived. What Remains of Edith Finch, released a few years after the burst of the walking sim bubble, found a way to redefine the genre, dying with little hope on the horizon. 

What set What Remains of Edith Finch apart from the rest of the genre is how it approached using the simplistic mechanics of walking simulators in order to take the short stories of the Edith family and tie them together into a unified theme. Playing as the last of the Finch line, you return to a house occupied for three generations that has seen the early and sudden deaths of every member of the Finch family. From the staggering number of environmental interactions to the mechanical twists in each story on how a walking simulator can be played, Edith Finch comes to find meaning through exploring the lives of these family members and forming her own axioms and truths around family and carrying the experiences around of those who came before her.

But what's most powerful about navigating this house built out of tragedy and grief is that the game never plants a flag to tell you what it wants you to take away from the experience. Every character has the knowledge of what will happen to each of them and chooses how to grieve, accept, and determine how to live with the weight of near-term mortality hanging around their neck at all times. Edith Finch takes these characters and shows us that the process of grief and sorrow is an individual's journey. If *Edith Finch* has anything it wants to convey, it's that finding the way to keep going, keep moving, and keep living despite the grim circumstances is as brave of an act as any.

### Dishonored 2

### The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

### Outer Wilds

There was never any doubt.

How do we begin to talk about this game? How do you sell anyone on a game where the best parts are best left discovered blindly? How do you tell someone why the game had an effect on you unlike any other game in the past decade without getting into the discoveries that completely drive what makes this game a masterpiece?

To describe it past a simple, high level concept of "you play as a kind, curious, non-violent alien race who is going to explore space to understand what happened to the race before them that went extinct" is to give away what makes the game so special, so monumental, so powerful. There are moments of truly astonishing awe and wonder that I never thought were possible in a game, but to explain the game past the simple premise reveals those moments that people should experience for themselves.

I have not stopped thinking about this game, and I finished it about six months ago. I so badly wish I could erase it from my mind so that I could experience it again for the first time. There is no game that I can think of this decade more than Outer Wilds that I have wanted to put into the hands of people and know that they are going to experience something truly profoundly moving in ways that I did not think was possible in games anymore.

Ending the decade with Outer Wilds is the best possible way gaming could have closed out the past ten years. What has felt like a shot in the arm to the hobby with a deluge of fresh, innovative ideas in the past few years of gaming has capped off with one of the most clever, wonderful, and creative games I have ever played. What a monumental achievement. 

Play Outer Wilds.
